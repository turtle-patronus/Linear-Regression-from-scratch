# Linear Regression from scratch

Implementation of multiple linear regression from scratch, without using any machine learning libraries (eg.:Scikit-learn).

A good exercise to delve into the mathematics behind any library's code implementation. 
A gateway to creating algorithms from scratch which will be useful when working on creating an auto-ml module.
