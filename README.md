This is an mplementation of multiple linear regression from scratch. The code is written from scratch and does *NOT* use existing functions or packages which can provide the Multiple Linear Regression regressor or fit/predict function (e.g. sklearn).

A good exercise to delve into the mathematics behind any library's code implementation. 

A gateway to creating algorithms from scratch which will be useful when working on creating an auto-ml module.
